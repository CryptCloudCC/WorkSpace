Views related to developing your organizations capabilities and features.

###### [Text Editor View](https://github.com/CryptCloudCC/CryptUI/issues/2)
This will likely be done with one of these projects:
- [Microsoft's Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)
- [CodeJar](https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar)
- [YACE](https://github.com/petersolopov/yace)
**Honorable Mentions For Text Editing Systems**
- [YANA](https://github.com/lukasbach/yana)
- [Blocksuite](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite)
- [DevSession](https://devsession.js.org/)

###### [Terminal/Shell View](https://github.com/CryptCloudCC/CryptUI/issues/1)
We will probably build the terminal view with [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js)

##### Collaboration Views
Views which can be used to better **express**/**convey** your *ideas*

###### [Canvas/Mindmap View](https://github.com/CryptCloudCC/CryptUI/issues/3)
We will build this using [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw)
My idea is to allow users to create their own mindmaps to better represent & convey their ideas!

###### [KanBan View](https://github.com/CryptCloudCC/CryptUI/issues/4)
We will create a [Wekan](https://wekan.github.io/)/[Trello](https://trello.com/) style `KanBan` view.
We want it to make use of `Drag n' Drop` functionality.
We want the `KanBan` to be able to: 
- *reference* `code` in [[CryptGit]]
- `Store` `tasks` within [[CryptDB]] using [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com)

# CryptCloud

**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to [[CryptCloud]]'s Knowledge Base!**

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/macOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.






## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [inbox](./inbox.md) - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [getting-started](./getting-started.md) - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [todo](assets/todos/CryptHub ToDo.md) - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.

## Submitting Issues

As you may have noticed, issues are disabled. With the goal to keep the project fairly easy to maintain, please file your issues in the main Foam repository:
